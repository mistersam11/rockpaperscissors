The Odin Project Rock, Paper, Scissors project

# Process
I created the pseudocode first, which was very helpful for my understanding of what was needed.
Then, I went through each subsection, creating the functions as necessary and then the game logic.
I created a game function and put the necessary function calls and variable assignments inside of it so they would be in its scope.

# Challenges
The biggest challenge for me was honestly the syntax, which wasn't so bad because it is easy to use stack overflow and MDN to find info. I got to use the developer tools to debug as well, which was often debugging syntax errors.
